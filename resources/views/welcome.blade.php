                In day-to-day life, we, the common people, face different types of social problems
                around us. But most often these issues cannot be reported properly to the proper authorities due to
                some massive roadblocks between victim and concerned authorities. Security threat, political
                pressure, lack of knowledge about responsible authorities are the most prevalent
                obstacles in our country. Also, there exists negligence of related authority like Police, RAB etc.

            </h4><br><h4>

                To overcome these roadblocks, we want to build uReporter, a unified online reporting
                system, which will send the reports as soon as possible to proper authorities after successful
                completion of several validation steps and reporters' personal information will be hidden. For this
                purpose, we will build a central repository system to store the reports from common people. Here,
                people can also share their experiences, supplement the previous reports, compliment about any
                authority. We will generate periodical reports through mining the valid data and public
                survey which depicts the real scenario of the society.
